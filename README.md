# MCP Deploy Automation

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for deployment automation. This server provides tools to manage deployments, environments, snapshots, and applications through DevOps Deploy's REST API.

## Features

- **üöÄ Quick Deployments**: Deploy snapshots or specific component versions to any environment
- **üì∏ Snapshot Management**: Create, list, and deploy snapshots
- **üåç Environment Management**: Discover and manage application environments
- **üìä Deployment Monitoring**: Track deployment status and progress
- **‚è∞ Scheduling**: Schedule deployments for future execution
- **üîÑ Automation**: Set up deployment triggers and recurring deployments
- **üìã Inventory Tracking**: See what's deployed where and compare environments

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- Access to an DevOps Deploy server
- Valid Deploy server access token

## Installation

```bash
npm install @securedevops/mcp-deploy-automation
```

## Configuration

Set up environment variables or provide command line arguments:

### Environment Variables
```bash
export DEPLOY_SERVER_URL="https://your-deploy-server:8443"
export DEPLOY_TOKEN="your-access-token"
```

## Best Practices

### üîë Use IDs Instead of Names
For better reliability and compatibility, always prefer using IDs over names when available:

1. **Start with discovery tools**: Use `list_applications` to get application IDs
2. **Get environment IDs**: Use `list_environments_for_application` to get environment IDs
3. **Get snapshot IDs**: Use `list_application_snapshots` to get snapshot IDs
4. **Use IDs in deployment operations**: This avoids naming conflicts and ensures accuracy

**Example workflow**:
```
1. list_applications ‚Üí Get application ID
2. list_environments_for_application ‚Üí Get environment IDs  
3. deploy_snapshot_to_environment using IDs instead of names
```

The tools will display both names and IDs in their output, making it easy to copy the IDs for subsequent operations.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Automated Production Deployment
**Scenario**: You need to deploy a tested snapshot to production environment during a maintenance window.

**Steps**:
1. "List all applications to find my target application"
### 2. Environment Promotion Pipeline
**Scenario**: You need to promote code through development ‚Üí staging ‚Üí production environments.

**Steps**:
1. "Compare staging environment with production to see what changes are pending"
2. "Create a snapshot from the current staging environment called 'release-candidate-v2.1.4'"
3. "Deploy the snapshot to production environment using the 'Production Deploy' process"
4. "Monitor deployment status and ensure successful completion"
5. "Verify production inventory matches the deployed snapshot"

**Benefits**: Safe, controlled promotion through environments with full visibility and verification.

### 3. Scheduled Maintenance Deployment
**Scenario**: You need to schedule critical updates during off-hours maintenance windows.

**Steps**:
1. "List all environments for the 'Banking Platform' application"
2. "Schedule deployment of 'security-patch-v1.2.1' snapshot to production for tomorrow at 2:00 AM"
3. "Set up a deployment trigger for automatic rollback if deployment fails"
4. "Schedule weekly recurring deployments for the staging environment"

**Benefits**: Automated deployment scheduling reduces manual intervention and ensures deployments happen during optimal times.
